    "**Note on Data:** The original data files for this project (`ML case Study.csv`, `Colleges.csv`, `cities.csv`) were not available. This notebook has been set up to run with **automatically generated placeholder data** that matches the expected schema. While the code demonstrates the full machine learning workflow, the analytical insights and model performance metrics are based on this synthetic data and should not be interpreted as findings from real-world data."
